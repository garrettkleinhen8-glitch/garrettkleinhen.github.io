  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    My interest in engineering developed from a natural curiosity about how things work and a desire to understand 
    systems beyond the surface level. I’ve always been drawn to problem solving that involves both analytical 
    thinking and hands on application, which ultimately led me to pursue mechanical engineering.
