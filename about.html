  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    My interest in engineering developed from a natural curiosity about how things 
    work and a desire to understand systems beyond the surface level. I’ve always 
    been drawn to problem solving that involves both analytical thinking and hands 
    on application, which ultimately led me to pursue mechanical engineering.
  </p>

 <p>
    I earned my degree in Mechanical Engineering to build a strong foundation in 
   design, analysis, and manufacturing principles. Throughout my education, I focused
   on applying theory through projects and practical work, developing skills in CAD, 
   design iteration, and structured problem solving.
  </p>

 <p>
  I’m currently part of a rotational engineering program, where I’ve been exposed to 
   different roles and ways engineering shows up in the real world. That experience
   has helped me better understand what I enjoy most and where I want to continue 
   growing as an engineer.
  </p>
   <p>Outside of work, I’m constantly working on projects of my own. I run multiple 3D printers, design and test my own models, and enjoy the full process from idea to design and iteration. I also enjoy staying active, especially snowboarding, getting outdoors, and spending time with my three dogs Fairley, Willow, and Hopper. </p>

 <p>This site is a mix of my professional work and my personal story. It highlights the projects I’ve worked on, the skills I’m developing, and the experiences that continue to shape my interest in engineering. </p>
