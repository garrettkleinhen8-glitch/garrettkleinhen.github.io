  <p>
    I’m a mechanical engineer who enjoys taking ideas from concept to physical
    reality. I’m most engaged when I can design in CAD, build with my hands,
    test performance, and improve the design through iteration.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m seeking roles that combine design, analysis, and hands-on work rather
    than purely desk-based engineering.

 <h3>Life Outside of Engineering</h3>

<p>
  Outside of engineering, I enjoy staying active, spending time with family and friends,
  and working on personal projects. These experiences help shape how I approach
  problem-solving, collaboration, and creativity.
